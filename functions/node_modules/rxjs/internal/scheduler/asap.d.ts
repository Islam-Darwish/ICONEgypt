 *
 * Asap Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Perform tasks as fast as it can be performed asynchronously</span>
 *
 * `asap` scheduler behaves the same as {@link asyncScheduler} scheduler when you use it to delay tasks
 * in time. If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing
 * code to end and then it will try to execute given tasks as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code
 * and start of scheduled tasks. This makes it best candidate for performing so called "deferring".
 * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves
 * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.
 *
 * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your tasks will be first to process
 * after currently executing code. In particular, if some tasks was also scheduled with `asap` before,
 * that tasks will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule tasks asynchronously, but
 * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.
 *
 * ## Example
 * Compare async and asap scheduler<
 * ```ts
 * import { asapScheduler, asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * asyncScheduler.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...
 * asapScheduler.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "asap"
 * // "async"
 * // ... but 'asap' goes first!
 * ```
 * @static true
 * @name asap
 * @owner Scheduler
