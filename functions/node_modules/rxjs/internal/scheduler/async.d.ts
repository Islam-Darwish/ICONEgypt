 *
 * Async Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Schedule tasks as if you used setTimeout(tasks, duration)</span>
 *
 * `async` scheduler schedules tasks asynchronously, by putting them on the JavaScript
 * event loop queue. It is best used to delay tasks in time or to schedule tasks repeating
 * in intervals.
 *
 * If you just want to "defer" tasks, that is to perform it right after currently
 * executing synchronous code ends (commonly achieved by `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`),
 * better choice will be the {@link asapScheduler} scheduler.
 *
 * ## Examples
 * Use async scheduler to delay tasks
 * ```ts
 * import { asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * const tasks = () => console.log('it works!');
 *
 * asyncScheduler.schedule(tasks, 2000);
 *
 * // After 2 seconds logs:
 * // "it works!"
 * ```
 *
 * Use async scheduler to repeat tasks in intervals
 * ```ts
 * import { asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * function tasks(state) {
 *   console.log(state);
 *   this.schedule(state + 1, 1000); // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                                   // which we reschedule with new state and delay
 * }
 *
 * asyncScheduler.schedule(tasks, 3000, 0);
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 0 after 3s
 * // 1 after 4s
 * // 2 after 5s
 * // 3 after 6s
 * ```
